I asked the following and received a response.  Don't want it to be overly complicated but it shouldn't be completely random either.


How did gold box games ("Gold Box Games" are the "gold" standard for AD&D 1E play) handle formations in combat?  What was the logic of who attacks what from both sides perspective?


The Gold Box games, such as *Pool of Radiance* and *Curse of the Azure Bonds*, handled combat on a tactical, turn-based grid that closely emulated the feel of the *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* tabletop game with miniatures.

The concept of a "formation" was not a pre-set, named option like "wedge" or "line," but rather the **tactical positioning and management of the party on the combat grid** by the player to enforce a defensive structure.

Here is a breakdown of how the Gold Box engine handled formations and attack logic:

### 1. Handling of Formations in Combat (Player Side)

The formation was entirely player-controlled and turn-based, designed to protect the weaker characters:

*   **Front-Line/Meat Shielding:** Players were expected to place their heavily armored fighters, paladins, and rangers on the front lines to engage enemies in melee. The common strategy was to form a defensive wall.
*   **Back-Line/Protection:** Characters with low Armor Class (AC) and hit points, such as **mages** and **clerics**, were positioned several squares behind the front-line fighters. This was critical because if a mage took damage before or during their turn, they could not successfully cast their spell for that round, a mechanic drawn directly from the *AD&D* rules.
*   **Tactical Movement:** Unlike some later RPGs, a character's position was not fixed. Each character used **Movement Points** to traverse the grid, allowing the player to constantly adjust their "formation" on the fly, retreat wounded characters, or move spellcasters to a position where they could launch an Area-of-Effect (AoE) spell like *Fireball* without hitting their allies.

### 2. Logic of Who Attacks What

The attack logic differed significantly between the Player's side (direct control) and the Enemy's side (AI-driven).

#### Player's Perspective (Direct Control)

The player has **complete, tactical control** over every action for every character in the party.

*   **Melee Attacks:** The player manually moves a fighter adjacent to a target and selects the specific enemy to attack.
*   **Ranged & Spell Attacks:** The player selects the target, or for AoE spells like *Fireball* or *Stinking Cloud*, manually selects the square that will serve as the center or starting point of the effect. This required a deep knowledge of the spell's shape to maximize enemy hits while minimizing friendly fire.
*   **Initiative Manipulation:** Players could choose to "Delay" a character's action until the end of the round. This was a common tactic for clerics (who could then heal an ally injured earlier in the round) or for controlling the positioning of a melee fighter.

#### Enemy's Perspective (AI Logic)

The enemy AI was generally straightforward but with specific, exploitable priorities, as noted by long-time players:

1.  **High-Priority Targets:** The AI often prioritized targets that presented the greatest immediate threat or vulnerability:
    *   **Spellcasters (Mages and Clerics):** They were a natural priority for enemies since hitting a spellcaster prevented them from casting their spell that turn.
    *   **Characters with Level-Draining, Poison, or Paralyzing Attacks:** Monsters that inflicted these conditions (e.g., Wraiths, Vampires, Ghouls) were immediately a priority target for the player, and similarly, the AI often focused on characters who were weakest against these effects or those who could prevent them.
2.  **Melee & Movement:** For basic enemies, the logic was often simple: **move into melee range and attack the nearest visible player character**. This simple logic is what made the "front-line" formation so effective—the fighters would be the nearest target, keeping the vulnerable casters safe.
3.  **Target Selection:** While basic, the AI was known to try and pick targets where they could maximize their advantage, though it could sometimes be tricked. For instance, players could exploit a mechanic where moving away from an enemy would trigger a "free attack" (an Attack of Opportunity) from the enemy, which would then prevent that enemy from taking its normal turn, effectively forcing a powerful monster to waste its turn on a simple, less damaging attack.
4.  **Target Weakness:** Enemies could also be programmed to prioritize the easiest targets to hit (lowest AC) or those with the lowest HP if they were within reach. This is why a mage wandering too close to the front line was often swarmed and killed quickly.
