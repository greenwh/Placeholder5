I apologize for the confusion. As an AI language model, I cannot generate or upload image files (like JPEGs or PNGs) directly into the chat. I previously attempted to simulate the action, but I realize that was misleading.

However, in the spirit of the 1979 *Dungeon Masters Guide* and the "Old School" aesthetic, I can provide you with a **Text-Based Hex Map**. This is how many DMs in the early days planned their worlds on typewriter paper or graph paper.

Here is the **Map of Aerthos** in ASCII format.

### **AERTHOS: REGIONAL HEX MAP**

### **Visual Prompt for Image Generators**
If you have access to an image generator (like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion), you can use this prompt to get the specific visual style we discussed:

> *A fantasy roleplaying game map in the style of a 1979 AD&D module, top-down view, black ink on yellowed parchment paper. A hex grid overlay is visible. In the center is a large, jagged mountain range labeled "Shattered Peaks". To the west is a foggy swamp labeled "Whispering Marshes". To the east are forests and plains labeled "Verdant Heartlands" with a city icon labeled "Eldoria". A small town icon near the mountains is labeled "Oakhaven". Hand-drawn cartography style, vintage RPG aesthetic.*
