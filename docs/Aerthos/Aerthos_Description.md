**Aerthos: A Fragmented Realm of Ancient Powers and Buried Secrets**

**Cosmology & Alignment:**
Aerthos exists within a cosmos where the Nine-Point Alignment system isn't just a guide for mortals, but a tangible force. Celestial beings embody Law and Chaos, Good and Evil, constantly subtly influencing events. True Neutrality is a powerful, if rare, state, often associated with ancient druidic orders or enigmatic planar travelers. Demons (Tanar'ri) and Devils (Baatezu) wage their eternal Blood War, with ripples occasionally impacting the mortal plane, seeking proxies and spreading corruption.

**Geography & Prominent Features:**

* **The Shattered Peaks:** A colossal mountain range dominating the central continent. Its jagged, impassable summits are home to reclusive dwarven strongholds, dangerous giants, and nests of monstrous avians. Deep within are ancient mine networks, some leading to the Underdark. The peaks are frequently shrouded in magically-induced storms.
* **The Whispering Marshes:** To the west, a vast, miasmic swamp perpetually covered in thick fog. It's home to lizardfolk tribes, hags, shambling mounds, and ancient ruins slowly sinking into the muck. Travel is slow, treacherous, and almost certainly leads to disease or monstrous encounters. Hidden throughout are powerful neutral-aligned fey creatures and forgotten druid circles.
* **The Sunken Coast:** The eastern seaboard, scarred by an ancient cataclysm that caused large parts of the land to sink beneath the waves. Now, treacherous archipelagos and submerged cities dot the waters. Merfolk, sahuagin, and horrifying aberrations from the deep rule these areas. Shipwrecks are common, promising both treasure and doom.
* **The Verdant Heartlands:** The most populated region, a mix of rolling hills, fertile plains, and dense, ancient forests. This is where most human kingdoms, elven enclaves, and halfling shires are found. However, even here, ancient barrow mounds hide undead, and secluded groves might be home to chaotic fey or even a solitary, powerful dragon.
* **The Scarred Wastes:** Far to the south, a desolate, volcanic land perpetually blighted by a curse from a long-dead sorcerer-king. Orc tribes, gnolls, and other savage humanoids roam here, constantly warring over scarce resources. Ancient, blasted fortresses stand as monuments to a forgotten age, often guarded by powerful elementals or constructs.

**Political Landscape & Factions:**

* **The Free Cities of Eldoria:** A loose confederation of human city-states in the Heartlands, each ruled by a powerful council or merchant guild. They are bastions of civilization, trade, and learning, but also hotbeds of intrigue, corruption, and thievery. They often hire adventurers for dangerous tasks. (Lawful Neutral / Chaotic Neutral leaning)
* **The Silvan Concordance:** The ancient elven kingdoms hidden deep within the oldest forests. They are aloof and isolationist, viewing shorter-lived races with a mix of disdain and detached curiosity. They guard ancient magical secrets and are fiercely protective of their lands. (Chaotic Good / Neutral Good leaning)
* **The Ironfast Dwarves:** Residing in the few remaining uncorrupted fortresses within the Shattered Peaks. They are proud, stubborn, and skilled artisans, but their numbers are dwindling due to ceaseless wars with goblins, duergar, and stranger creatures from below. (Lawful Good / Lawful Neutral leaning)
* **The Cult of the Serpent Eye:** A pervasive, insidious cult that worships an ancient, extra-planar entity of pure chaos and evil. They operate in the shadows of every major city, seeking to undermine order, spread discord, and eventually unleash their dark patron upon Aerthos. (Chaotic Evil)
* **The Grey Wardens:** A scattered order of monster hunters, scholars, and wilderness guides, dedicated to understanding and combating the myriad threats that plague Aerthos. They are often neutral, valuing knowledge and survival above strict dogma. (True Neutral / Neutral Good leaning)

**Magic & Mystery:**

* **Magic is Potent and Perilous:** Spells are powerful but often have specific components (material, verbal, somatic) that must be strictly adhered to. High-level magic is rare and feared. Mages are often reclusive, guarding their spellbooks fiercely.
* **Ancient Artifacts:** Aerthos is littered with the remnants of past ages – powerful magic items, cursed relics, and unique artifacts that can shift the balance of power. These are rarely found in pristine condition and often carry their own dangers or demands.
* **Planar Rifts:** The barriers between Aerthos and other planes are thin in certain places, particularly in ancient ruins or areas of intense magical confluence. This means encounters with extra-planar creatures (elementals, genies, even lower-level demons/devils) are a distinct possibility.

**AD&D Flavor & Campaign Hooks:**

* **Resource Management is Key:** Encumbrance rules are important! Players will need to carefully consider what equipment they carry. Supplies like rations, torches, and rope are vital.
* **Dangerous Wilderness:** Travel between locations is not safe. Random encounter tables for each region are long and varied, ensuring that even a simple journey can become a life-or-death struggle.
* **Dungeon Delving Focus:** Many adventures will involve exploring multi-level dungeons filled with traps, puzzles, and a diverse array of monsters from the Monster Manual. Careful mapping is essential.
* **Alignment Matters:** NPCs will react differently based on the characters' visible alignments. Good-aligned characters might find aid in temples, while evil ones might be sought out by nefarious patrons.
* **Mysteries and Lore:** The world is old, filled with forgotten empires, ancient evils, and lost histories. Discovering these secrets is a core part of the adventure.
