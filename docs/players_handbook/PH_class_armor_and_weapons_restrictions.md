### Notes and Restrictions

*   **Weapons\*:** This heading includes any magical weapons of the type named, unless use by the class in question is specifically proscribed in the description of the magic weapon.
*   **Cleric Weapons:** Clerics are forbidden to use **edged and/or pointed weapons which shed blood** (e.g., axes, darts, javelins, long swords, scimitars, spears).
*   **Cleric/Paladin Poison Restriction\*\*:** The prohibition on using poison is strictly for **Clerics who are not of evil alignment** and **Paladins**. Evil Clerics may use poison if permitted by the DM. Paladins are **never** permitted to use poison.
*   **Druid Armor Restriction:** Druids are unable to use **any armor or shields other than leather armor and wooden shields** (metallic armor spoils their magical powers).
*   **Fighter/Assassin Weapon Restriction\*\*\*:** Characters under 5' height cannot employ the **longbow** or any weapon over 12' in length. Those under 100 pounds of body weight cannot use the **heavy crossbow** or **pole arms** in excess of 200 gold piece weight equivalent, including **two-handed swords**.
*   **Magic-User/Illusionist Restriction:** Magic-users and illusionists can wear **no armor** and have few weapons they can use, as martial training is foreign to magic-use.
*   **Thief Weapon Restriction\*\*\*\*:** A thief may use a **short sword, broad sword, or long sword** but not a **bastard sword** or a **two-handed sword**.
*   **Monk Restriction:** Monks can wear **no armor** and use only the listed weapons. They cannot use oil, poison, or magical scrolls of spells.

### Multi-Class and Dual-Class Restrictions

*   **Multi-Class (Non-Human/Semi-Human):** Characters who are multi-classed (e.g., Fighter/Magic-User, Cleric/Fighter/Magic-User) are typically bound by the **limitations of the thief class only** when a thief class is part of the combination.
    *   *Fighter/Magic-User:* Can benefit from both armor, weaponry, and spells.
    *   *Fighter/Thief:* Is limited by the constraints of the thief class (e.g., leather armor only).
    *   *Cleric Combinations (with Fighter types):* Cleric combinations may use edged weapons.
*   **Dual-Class (Human):** When a human character switches from one class to another:
    *   The character **retains the hit dice** (and commensurate hit points) of the original class.
    *   All other functions of the character are at **1st level** of the new class.
    *   If the character uses any capabilities or functions of their **former class**, they **gain no experience** for the adventure.
    *   Once the new class level **exceeds** the former class level, the character gains the benefit of a new class hit die and can **mix functions freely**, although **restrictions regarding armor, shield, and/or weapon apply** with regard to operations particular to one or both classes (e.g., a former Fighter/new Magic-User can wear armor but not use spells while wearing it, or a former Magic-User/new Fighter can use *any* weapon/armor).
