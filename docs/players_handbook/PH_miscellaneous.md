## ALIGNMENT

The alignment system is **Law/Chaos/Neutral** on one axis and **Good/Evil/Neutral** on the other, creating nine possibilities:

*   **Lawful Good (LG)**, Lawful Neutral (LN), **Lawful Evil (LE)**
*   **Neutral Good (NG)**, **True Neutral (N)**, Neutral Evil (NE)
*   **Chaotic Good (CG)**, Chaotic Neutral (CN), **Chaotic Evil (CE)**

| Alignment | Core Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chaotic Evil (CE)** | Freedom, randomness, and woe. Disdains law, order, kindness, good deeds. Life has no value. |
| **Chaotic Good (CG)** | Freedom and randomness are ultimate truths, but also values life and individual welfare. |
| **Chaotic Neutral (CN)** | Places randomness and disorder above all else; good and evil are balance arms. |
| **Lawful Evil (LE)** | Respects laws and strict order; life, beauty, truth, and freedom are valueless. |
| **Lawful Good (LG)** | Strict in law and order, but to improve the common weal. Values truth, life, and beauty. |
| **Lawful Neutral (LN)** | Views regulation as all-important; a middle road between evil and good. Harmony rests on law and order. |
| **Neutral Evil (NE)** | Pure evil is all-in-all; views law and chaos as unnecessary. Either may be used to bring maximum evilness to the world. |
| **Neutral Good (NG)** | Believes in regulation and freedom to bring the best to the world for living things. |
| **True Neutral (N)** | All other alignments are facets of the system; all aspects must be retained in balance. Nature will prevail. |
