## ARMOR

### ARMOR CLASS TABLE

The Armor Class (AC) rating determines how difficult a character is to strike with a weapon. A lower AC number is better. AC is based on the type of armor worn, the inclusion of a shield, and modifications from Dexterity and magical effects.

| Type of Armor | Armor Class Rating |
| :--- | :---: |
| None | 10 |
| Shield only | 9 |
| Leather or padded armor | 8 |
| Leather or padded armor + shield / studded leather/ring mail | 7 |
| Studded leather or ring mail + shield / scale mail | 6 |
| Scale mail + shield/chain mail | 5 |
| Chain mail + shield/splint mail/banded mail | 4 |
| Splint or banded mail + shield / plate mail | 3 |
| Plate mail + shield | 2 |

### Summary Description of Armor

#### Armor Class (AC)

*   **AC Rating:** The base AC rating is determined by the armor worn. AC 10 is unarmored (the worst), and AC 2 (*Plate mail + shield*) is the best non-magical protection.
*   **Shield Effects:**
    *   A **small shield** raises the AC by 1 (e.g., from AC 10 to AC 9), effectively reducing the opponent's "to hit" roll by -1. It can be counted against only one attack per melee round.
    *   A **normal-sized shield** raises the AC by 1 and can be counted against two attacks per melee round.
    *   A **large shield** raises the AC by 1 and can be counted against up to three attacks per melee round.
    *   Attacks from the right flank and rear always negate the advantage of the shield.
*   **Dexterity Adjustment:** The character's Dexterity modifier is applied to their AC (Defense Adjustment on **DEXTERITY TABLE I**). A high Dexterity gives an AC bonus (lower AC number, better protection), and a low Dexterity gives a penalty (higher AC number, worse protection).
    *   *Example:* A character with Plate mail (AC 3) and a shield (AC 2) and a Dexterity of 18 (Defensive Adjustment -4) has a final AC of -2 (2 + (-4)).
*   **Magical Armor and Shields:** For each $+1$ of magic on armor or a shield, the AC decreases by 1 (gets better).
    *   *Example:* A non-armored character (AC 10) with a *+1 shield* (AC 9) has an effective AC 8. A *Plate mail +3* and a *magic shield +5* are treated as AC -6 (or AC 2 with a subtraction of 8 from the attacker's "to hit" dice rolls).

#### Encumbrance and Restrictions

*   **Weight:** The cost of armor generally reflects its protective quality.
    *   Light armor/gear (Leather, Padded, Studded, Ring) allows for *Normal* movement (12").
    *   Heavy armor/gear (Scale, Chain, Splinted, Banded) results in *Slowed* movement (9") and *Lumbering Run* (for short distances).
    *   Very heavy gear (Plate) results in *Slowed Greatly* movement (3" to 4") and *No Trotting Possible*.
*   **Magic Armor:** Magic armor **negates weight** for movement purposes, meaning it does not impose an encumbrance penalty.

| Type of Armor | Cost (g.p.) | Armor Class Rating |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Plate mail + shield | 415 | 2 |
| Splint or banded mail + shield / Plate mail | 110/110 | 3 |
| Chain mail + shield/splint mail/banded mail | 90/90/90 | 4 |
| Scale mail + shield/chain mail | 60/90 | 5 |
| Studded leather or ring mail + shield / Scale mail | 25/40/60 | 6 |
| Leather or padded armor + shield / studded leather/ring mail | 20/19/40 | 7 |
| Leather or padded armor | 5/4 | 8 |
| Shield only | 15/10/1 | 9 |
| None | - | 10 |

#### ARMOR WEIGHT

(Derived from Basic Equipment and Supplies Costs: **10 g.p. = 1 lb.**)

| Armor Type | Cost (g.p.) | **Approximate Weight (lbs.)** | Armor Class Rating |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Plate** | 400 | **40 lbs.** | (AC 3) |
| **Banded** | 90 | **9 lbs.** | (AC 4) |
| **Splinted** | 80 | **8 lbs.** | (AC 4) |
| **Chain** | 75 | **7.5 lbs.** | (AC 5) |
| **Scale** | 45 | **4.5 lbs.** | (AC 6) |
| **Ring** | 30 | **3 lbs.** | (AC 7) |
| **Studded** | 15 | **1.5 lbs.** | (AC 7) |
| **Leather** | 5 | **0.5 lbs.** | (AC 8) |
| **Padded** | 4 | **0.4 lbs.** | (AC 8) |
| **Helmet, great** | 15 | **1.5 lbs.** | - |
| **Helmet, small** | (10 s.p. = 0.5 g.p.) | **0.05 lbs.** | - |
| **Shield, large** | 15 | **1.5 lbs.** | (+1 AC) |
| **Shield, small** | 10 | **1.0 lbs.** | (+1 AC) |
| **Shield, small, wooden** | 1 | **0.1 lbs.** | (+1 AC) |

#### Encumbrance Classification (from OCR Text)

The derived weight corresponds to the general encumbrance classifications mentioned in the **MOVEMENT - TIME AND DISTANCE FACTORS** section (page 102):

| Encumbrance Type | Gear/Armor Examples | Approx. Total Weight (lbs.) | Movement Rate (Dungeon) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Normal Gear** | $\approx$ 35 lbs. and no great bulk | 35 lbs. | 12" |
| **Heavy Gear** | $\approx$ 70 lbs. or fairly bulky | 70 lbs. | 9" (Lumbering Run) |
| **Very Heavy Gear** | $\approx$ 105 lbs. and bulky (Plate armor) | 105 lbs. | 6" (Slowed) |
| **Encumbered** | $\approx$ 105+ lbs. weight and/or very bulky | 105+ lbs. | 3" to 4" (Slowed Greatly) |

*Note: The armor costs are very low in the OCR text (e.g., Plate is 400 g.p.), which is an apparent typo or abbreviation in the provided 'Reference Sheets' compared to official PHB values (where a suit of plate mail is typically 400 g.p., and other armors are in the thousands). However, using the provided cost/weight ratio (10 g.p. = 1 lb.) gives the weights listed above, which align with the general encumbrance categories.*
