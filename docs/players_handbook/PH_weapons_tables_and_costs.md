### GENERAL WEAPON DESCRIPTION SUMMARY

*   **Size (S or M, L):** The "Damage Vs. Opponent Size" columns show the base damage dice for an opponent of Small (S) or Medium (M) size, and Large (L) size, respectively.
*   **Weight (GP):** Weapon weight is measured in Gold Pieces (GP), where 10 GP = 1 lb. This affects encumbrance.
*   **Length (c. x'):** The length of the weapon in feet. Longer weapons (polearms, two-handed swords) typically have higher speed factors but require more space.
*   **Space Required (x'):** The minimum space in feet required to wield the weapon effectively.
*   **Speed Factor:** A number representing the quickness of the weapon. Lower is faster. Used in combat to determine the order of strikes in a melee round.
*   **Hand Held Damage vs. Size:** Shows the base damage dice (e.g., 1-8, 2-12).
    *   **Italics:** Polearms/Lances/Tridents can dismount a rider if the "to hit" die roll is high enough (equal to or greater than the score required to hit AC 0).
*   **Spear/Lance Notes:**
    *   **Lance (Light/Medium/Heavy Horse):** Deals twice the indicated damage against creatures of any size when employed by an attacker riding a **charging** mount.
    *   **Spear/Pike/Voulge (Set):** Deals twice the indicated damage to any opponent when the weapon is **set** (firmly grounded) to receive their charge.
*   **Hurled/Missile Damage:** Shows the damage dice (e.g., 1-6, 2-7). Missile weapons (bows/crossbows) have varying rates of fire.
