## CHARACTER ABILITIES

Every character has six principal characteristics: **Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA)**. Scores are determined by random number generation (dice rolling). Exceptional scores (15 or above) are important, often requiring a minimum of 15 in no fewer than two abilities for optimum survival.
