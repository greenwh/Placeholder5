## COMBAT PROCEDURES

Most magical combat and breath weapons do not require the attacker to determine if the weapon hits, but the target creatures are allowed **saving throws** to see if they avoided the attack or at least partially negated it. Other attacks require a **"to hit" dice roll** by the attackers, and **damage is always scored if the hit is made**.

### 1. SAVING THROW

The saving throw (save) represents the chance to **avoid or partially negate** magical and breath attack forms.

*   **Items Save:** Magic items and even normal items/weapons must also save against attacks (e.g., a suit of magic armor struck by a lightning bolt).
*   **Tables:** Your Dungeon Master (DM) has tables showing the scores required to save against these attack forms, categorized by:
    1.  The **class** of the character.
    2.  The **level of experience** in that class.
*   **Modifiers:** The base save numbers are modified by:
    1.  The **power of the attack**.
    2.  **Magical protections** and **character class and race** bonuses/penalties (e.g., Dwarf/Gnome/Halfling bonuses to save vs. magic/poison, Paladin +2 bonus on all saves).

### 2. ARMOR CLASS

The overall Armor Class (AC) of a character includes the type of armor worn, the inclusion of a shield, magical factors, and Dexterity. A low AC is always better.

*   **AC Calculations:**
    *   **Base AC:** Determined by armor type (Plate + shield is AC 2, None is AC 10).
    *   **Shield:** Adds +1 AC (subtracts -1 from opponent's "to hit" die roll) against a limited number of frontal attacks per round.
    *   **Dexterity:** The character's Dexterity modifier is applied to their AC.
    *   **Size Ratio:** In some cases, a size differential penalty applies (e.g., a Dwarf fighting a Giant subtracts 4 from the Giant's "to hit" die roll, making the Dwarf's effective AC much better).
*   **Opponent's "To Hit" Dice Roll:** The attacker's rolled "to hit" die score is compared to the defender's AC, modified by factors such as the attacker's Strength, Weapon Factors, and position.

### 3. FIRST STRIKE (Initiative)

The 1-minute melee round assumes simultaneous activity, but once during this period, each combatant gets the opportunity to strike a "real blow."

*   **Initiative Roll:** Usually determined by rolling 2d6 for the party and a separate 2d6 (or different colored die) for the monsters/opponents.
*   **Action Order:** The group with the **higher die score** acts first.
*   **Exceptions:**
    *   **Haste/Slow:** Slowed creatures always strike last. Hasted/speeded creatures strike first.
    *   **Fighters:** High-level fighters with multiple blows per round usually strike first and last in a round, regardless of initiative.
    *   **Position/Weapon Length:** Dexterity and Weapon Speed factors can affect the order of strikes in important single combats, as adjudicated by the DM.
*   **Surprise:** If surprise occurs, the surprising party acts in the lost segments of time lost by the surprised party, and no initiative check is needed during that time.

### 4. WEAPON FACTORS

The DM uses weapon factors to determine the relative efficiency of weapons in melee combat by relating them to the Attack Matrices.

*   **Factors include:** Damage, Weight, Length, Space Required, and Speed Factor (see **COMBINED WEAPONS TABLES**).
*   **Attack Matrices:** The DM has matrices for each class of character by level group, showing the scores required to hit the various Armor Classes.

### 5. MONSTER ATTACK DAMAGE

*   **Weapons:** Monsters using weapons attack much as characters do.
*   **Natural Weaponry:** Monsters with natural weaponry (claws, talons, fangs, tusks, horns, etc.) use a separate **Monster Attack Matrix**.

### 6. DAMAGE

Damage is measured in **Hit Points (HP)**.

*   **Death:** If any creature reaches 0 or negative HP, it is dead.
*   **Exceptions:** Certain magical means (e.g., *ring of regeneration*) can prevent actual death.
*   **Falling Damage:** Falling inflicts **1d6 HP damage for each 10' of distance fallen**, to a maximum of 20d6 (plus or minus adjustments for the surface fallen upon). This is considered a less "realistic" rule to favor character survival.

### 7. HEALING

*   **Rest:** The most mundane way to restore HP is by resting. **1 HP is restored for each day of rest**. After 30 game days, HP accrues at the rate of 5 per day thereafter.
*   **Magical Means:** Spells (*cure light/serious/critical wounds, heal, regenerate, restoration, resurrection*), potions, and magical devices can quickly restore lost HP.
*   **HP Limit:** Hit points can **never exceed** the total initially rolled for the character (max HP) plus any bonuses (e.g., Constitution, magical items).
