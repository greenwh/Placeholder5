Of course. While the *Monster Manual* is the primary source for detailed monster descriptions in AD&D, the *Dungeon Masters Guide* contains several crucial lists and tables of monsters. These are primarily used by the DM for calculating experience points and, most importantly, for populating random encounters.

The most comprehensive list is the **Alphabetical Recapitulation of Monsters** in Appendix E. This appendix provides the core game statistics for a vast number of creatures so the DM can run encounters without having to constantly reference the *Monster Manual*.

Here is a summary of the monsters found within the *Dungeon Masters Guide*, organized by where they appear in the book.
