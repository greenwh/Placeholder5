# The World of Aerthos: Campaign Guide (Expanded)

## I. Climate & Ecology (Applying Page 87)
*The DMG states (p. 87) that climate need not follow Earth's laws, but must be consistent. It also warns against placing large predators without a food source.*

*   **The Atmospheric Blanket:** The **Shattered Peaks** are so high they pierce the atmosphere's "blanket." As per the DMG notes on elevation, the air here is thin and bitterly cold. However, thermal vents from the dwarven deep-mines create artificial warm pockets, causing constant, violent interactions between cold air and warm steam—resulting in the perpetual magical storms known as "The Anvil’s Breath."
*   **The Greenhouse Effect:** The **Whispering Marshes** suffer from a permanent "Greenhouse Effect" (p. 87). Heavy, magical cloud cover traps the heat rising from the swamp's decomposition. Even at night, the temperature rarely drops below 80°F.
*   **Predator/Prey Logic:**
    *   *The Problem:* The Shattered Peaks are home to Hill Giants and Griffons.
    *   *The Ecological Solution:* As suggested by the text, there is a rapid-growth food source. The **"Rock-Moss"** (a purple, lichen-like tuber) grows overnight on the peaks. Massive herds of **Mountain Goats** and **Giant Marmots** feed on this, breeding prolifically. This abundance of herd animals explains how the Giants survive without constantly raiding human lands (though they prefer the taste of humans!).

## II. Social Structure & Government (Applying pp. 88-89)
*The PDF advises against random tables for social class, suggesting tailored structures instead. It lists specific government forms.*

### The Free Cities of Eldoria
*   **Government Form:** **Syndicracy** (Government by a body of syndics, each representing a business interest - p. 89).
*   **Social Classes:**
    *   **Upper Class (The Syndics):** Guildmasters of the Iron, Grain, and Cloth guilds. Only they can vote for the "High Syndic."
    *   **Middle Class:** Master artisans, mercenaries with property >100 acres (retired adventurers), and lesser priests.
    *   **Lower Class:** Laborers, apprentices, and "Freemen" (adventurers starting out).
*   **Titles:** The ruler of Eldoria is not a King, but a **Doge** or **Burgomaster** (p. 89).

### The Ironfast Dwarves
*   **Government Form:** **Geriatocracy** (Government reserved to the elderly - p. 89).
*   **Structure:** The "Iron Council" consists only of dwarves over the age of 300. Younger dwarves, regardless of wealth or prowess, have no political voice until they "gray."

## III. Economics, Taxes, & Tolls (Applying p. 90)
*The DMG highlights that fantasy economies are inflationary and that taxes are oppressive.*

*   **The Adventurer's Tax:** In the border town of **Oakhaven** (gateway to the Shattered Peaks), the influx of gold from ruins has caused inflation.
    *   *Price Adjustment:* A standard torch costs 1 silver piece here (10x normal) because adventurers will pay it.
    *   **The Gate Toll:** Entering Oakhaven requires a fee of **5 coppers for non-citizens** (p. 90).
    *   **Currency Exchange:** Merchants in Eldoria refuse ancient coin found in dungeons. Players must visit the "Street of Money Changers," who charge a **10% tax** to convert ancient gold into stamped Eldorian Crowns (p. 90).
    *   **Property Tax:** If players wish to buy a safehouse, they must pay **20 gold pieces** annually in tax, or face confiscation (p. 88).

## IV. The Starting Campaign Area (Applying pp. 91-99)
*The PDF suggests starting small: a settlement, a background, and a nearby ruin.*

**The Settlement: Oakhaven**
*   **Typical Inhabitants (p. 88):** The majority are "Laboring Males/Females" (HP 2-7, 0 Level). They are farmers, miners, and tavern staff. They are *not* fighters. If the players start a brawl, the town militia (1st level fighters) will be summoned.
*   **The Rumor:** A "Guide" (actually a 3rd Level Thief NPC, similar to the example on p. 96) tells the party of the **Ruined Keep of Kaldor**.

**The Dungeon: The Ruined Keep of Kaldor**
*   **Monster Placement Logic (p. 91):** The Keep was abandoned by humans due to a plague.
    *   *Current Residents:* A tribe of **Goblins** has moved in, not because they are random monsters, but because they were driven out of the Shattered Peaks by the Ogres. They are refugees, making them desperate and dangerous.
    *   *Ecology:* The Goblins utilize the Keep's cellars to grow mushrooms (food source).
*   **Treasure Placement (p. 92):**
    *   The Goblins do *not* have chests of gold.
    *   *Loot:* They have stolen goods: bolts of silk, a cask of fine wine (worth 20gp), and perhaps a single **silver necklace** hidden in a rotting mattress (investigation required).
    *   *Magic Items:* As per page 93, do not place powerful items yet. Perhaps the Goblin leader has a **Dagger +1** that he uses to bully the others.

## V. NPC Persona Generation (Applying p. 100)
*Using the tables on page 100 to generate a rival for the party.*

**NPC: Silas the "Merchant"**
*   **Race:** Human
*   **Class:** Fighter (Retired)
*   **Alignment:** **Lawful Evil** (Uses the law to exploit).
*   **Appearance:**
    *   *Age:* Mature (5)
    *   *General:* Immaculate (4) - rare for this border region.
*   **Sanity:** Very Stable (1).
*   **Possessions:** Superabundant (0). He owns the only equipment shop in Oakhaven.
*   **General Tendencies (d12/d6):**
    *   *Trait 1:* Suspicious/Cautious (12)
    *   *Trait 2:* Precise/Exacting (13)
*   **Role:** Silas buys the loot players find but offers only 40% value, citing "taxes." If players argue, he uses his "Precise" nature to find flaws in the goods. He is a primary antagonist not through combat, but through economics.

## Visualizing Aerthos

Here are three prompts/descriptions to help visualize this "Old School" version of Aerthos:

### 1. The Gate of Oakhaven (The Economic Reality)
**Description:** A gritty, pencil-sketch style scene. A muddy road leads to a wooden palisade gate. A bored, armored guard (City Watch) holds a spear, demanding a toll from a group of weary adventurers. A sign nailed to the wood reads "NON-CITIZENS: 5 COPPERS. NO WEAPONS BONDED." Rain falls heavily.
> *Caption: "Duties, Excises, and Fees: The true enemy of the adventurer."*

### 2. The Ecology of the Shattered Peaks
**Description:** A wide landscape shot. Massive, jagged mountains pierce the clouds. On a rocky outrag, a massive Hill Giant is herding a flock of shaggy, six-legged mountain goats (the prolific food source). In the distance, a magical purple storm ("The Anvil's Breath") is brewing. The style should be reminiscent of 1970s fantasy book covers.
> *Caption: "Monster Populations: Logic dictates that large predators require ample prey."*

### 3. The Syndic's Court
**Description:** An interior view of a stone council chamber in Eldoria. Three "Syndics" sit on high-backed chairs. One is fat and wears fine silks (Cloth Guild), one is muscular with soot stains (Iron Guild), one is withered and holds a ledger (Grain Guild). They look down imperiously at a petitioner. The lighting is torch-lit and moody.
