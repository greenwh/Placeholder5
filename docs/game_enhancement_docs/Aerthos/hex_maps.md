Here are the requested maps for Aerthos: The Continental Overview, and detailed settlement maps for Oakhaven and Eldoria.

## 2. CITY MAP: OAKHAVEN

**The Border Town (Focus: Logistics & Taxes)**
Oakhaven is a rough, fortified town where *resource management is key* and the local economy is inflated due to adventurer gold. This is the **Starting Campaign Area** (per DMG p. 91).

                 **5 COPPER TOLL HERE**
```

**Oakhaven Key Hooks:**

*   **The Gate:** The primary tax collection point. Refusing to pay the **5cp Gate Toll** (DMG p. 90) leads to an encounter with the town militia.
*   **Silas' Shop [S]:** The **Lawful Evil** merchant who offers poor prices, exploiting the party's need for quick cash.
*   **The Dirty Mug [I]:** The source of most **rumors** (DMG p. 96). This is where the party hears about the goblin refugees in the **Ruined Keep of Kaldor (Kd)**.
*   **Syndic Office [G]:** Handles all property and currency exchange. The 10% tax on ancient gold is paid here.

## 3. CITY MAP: ELDORIA

**The Free City (Focus: Syndicracy & Political Intrigue)**
Eldoria is a large, wealthy city, representing the height of Lawful/Chaotic Neutral human civilization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Eldoria Key Hooks:**

*   **The Syndics' Court [C]:** The hub of **Lawful Evil** power. Quests may involve being hired by, or working against, one of the three ruling Guildmasters (Iron, Cloth, Grain).
*   **Street of Money Changers:** A necessary stop for converting dungeon loot. It highlights the **oppressive taxes** (DMG p. 90) and is a prime location for encounters with the **Cult of the Serpent Eye**.
*   **Poor District [P]:** The largest section of **0-Level Laboring Males/Females** (DMG p. 88). This is where the **Chaotic Evil** cultists recruit and hide.
*   **Docks [D] & Warehouses [W]:** Ideal locations for theft, smuggling operations, and high-value recovery missions, often initiated by one Syndic against another.
